# API Testing with PostMan (dmoney-api-newman)
This is a simple API testing project where I test an API (DMoney), primarily a fintech API. 
Users can perform all their financial transactions using it, similar to mobile banking apps (Nagad/Bkash, etc.).

I have conducted all the tests manually and created test cases covering all the features of this API. As a result, I established assertion points for API automation. Additionally, I have chained multiple APIs using Postman and generated reports using Newman.
